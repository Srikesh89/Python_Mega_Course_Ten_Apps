This repo holds my code following the Udemy class
'The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Application'

The following is what has been pursued in the course:
1. I got a 93% on the practice test meaning I can skip sections 2 through 12
    a. I missed the question for output when you perform 'John' ** 2
        i. Answer was type error and NOT 'JohnJohn'
    b. I missed the question for writing to text file
        i. if you open a text file with 'w' permission twice, you
            OVERWRITE the file, NOT append to the file
2. Application 1: Building an English Thesaurus
3. Section 15:
    a. pandas: a library providing data structures and data analysis code/tools
    b. allows you to load information from different data sources
    c. tables/text/visualization libraries (bokeh)
    d. ipython is a terminal for data visualization that preceeded Jupyter Notebooks
    e. jupyter notebook: hybrid between interactive shell and editor
4. Section 16:
    a. using numpy to do solve more complicated number based problems
5. Application 2:
    a. base layer, marker layer, and polygon layer using folium library
    b. utilize feature groups to organize the different layers
    c. folium.Map() creates base layer
    d. folium.FeatureGroup() creates disparate layers that contain data
    e. Map.add_child(FeatureGroup) nesting
    f. use lambda functions to enable styling for polygon layer
6. Section 18: Fixing Programming Errors
7. Application 3: Section 19 and 20
    a. ingest data into a panda dataframe
    b. manipulate dataframe and plot line/bar/pie graphs/charts using matlibplot
    c. use the JustPY library to generate charts (python to javascript library) that uses common js highcharts
    d. convert a panda to load into a js chart and display interactive graphs
